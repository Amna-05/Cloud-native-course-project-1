# Upwork Proposal Writer

Writes concise, personalized proposals that convert client inquiries into job offers.

## The Winning Formula (2026)

Templates don't win jobs—**clarity, relevance, and proof** do. Clients see hundreds of nearly identical copy-paste proposals weekly and can instantly spot lack of effort.

### What Kills Proposals

- Generic introductions ("I'm a talented freelancer...")
- Relying on templates or copy-paste framework
- Long-winded credentials instead of client focus
- Missing proof (no numbers, links, or samples)
- Vague timelines or deliverables
- Attaching 5+ work samples (shows unfocus)

### What Wins Proposals

- **Opening with 2 specifics from the client's brief** (shows you actually read it)
- **Stating the client's pain + your solution** (not about you, about them)
- **3-4 clear bullets** with concrete deliverables
- **1 testable first milestone** (proves you'll deliver)
- **1 proof point** (number + link/artifact, not just credentials)
- **Concrete fit, timeline, rate** (no fluff)
- **Manual customization** (mention their recent work or specific pain)
- **Only 2 relevant samples** (quality over quantity)

## Quick Start

```
[2 specifics from brief] → [Their pain] → [Your solution] → [Bullets] → [Proof] → [Milestone] → [Timeline + Rate]
```

### Real Winning Example

```
I see your Shopify checkout is causing errors (from your job post),
which means lost sales on mobile. Let's fix that so your store runs
smoothly and you stop losing revenue to cart abandonment.

What I'll do:
• Debug and fix checkout errors (test on all device sizes)
• Optimize page load speed (under 2 seconds target)
• Add cart recovery email setup
• Deploy to production with rollback plan

First milestone: Checkout fully functional and tested on mobile within 5 days.

I've fixed 12+ Shopify checkouts (reduced checkout friction by 35% avg).
See sample: [link to portfolio]

Timeline: 2 weeks start-to-finish. Rate: $X/hr.

Questions? Happy to jump on a quick call.
```

### Another Example (Dev Work)

```
Your API is timing out on high-load requests (you mentioned in the post),
causing user frustration and failed signups. We need to optimize the
database queries and add caching.

Here's my approach:
• Audit current database queries (identify bottlenecks)
• Implement Redis caching layer for hot queries
• Refactor slow endpoints (batch calls, lazy loading)
• Load test to ensure 500+ concurrent users

First milestone: Baseline performance metrics captured within 3 days.

I optimized a similar FastAPI service for a fintech company—reduced
p99 latency from 800ms to 150ms. Results: [link to case study or artifact]

Timeline: 3 weeks. Rate: $X/hr.

Let's discuss: Are there specific endpoints causing the most friction?
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Job Posting (Really)
Extract 2-3 specific details from the client's brief:
- Their exact pain point (not generic version)
- Technical specifics (tool, framework, API, metric)
- Their desired outcome

### Step 2: Write Your Opening (2-3 Lines)
Use this pattern:
```
I see [specific problem from their brief],
which means [consequence].
[Your solution in one sentence].
```

**Example**: "I see your React app is re-rendering on every state change,
which means your users experience lag. Let's optimize the component hierarchy
and memoization."

### Step 3: Structure Your Approach (3-4 Bullets)
Each bullet = one concrete deliverable

**NOT**: "Provide great web design"
**YES**: "Create 5 mobile-optimized mockups (Figma), test on 4 device sizes, iterate based on feedback"

### Step 4: Define First Milestone
When will you prove you can do the work?

**Strong**: "First milestone: Database schema designed and reviewed by client within 5 days."
**Weak**: "First milestone: Project kickoff"

### Step 5: Add One Proof Point
- Quantified result: "Reduced load time by 45%" + link
- Client list: "Worked with [industry names]" (if high-profile)
- Portfolio: Link to 1-2 most relevant samples

**No credentials alone** ("10 years experience") — that doesn't prove you can solve *this* problem.

### Step 6: State Concrete Fit
- **Timeline**: "2 weeks" (not "flexible")
- **Rate**: "$X/hr" or "$Y fixed" (not "let's discuss")
- **Availability**: "Available to start by [date]"

### Step 7: Close with Engagement
Ask one specific question or offer to discuss next steps.

### Step 8: Verify
```bash
python scripts/verify.py --proposal "your_proposal.txt"
```

## Proposal Length

- **Ideal**: 150-250 words
- **Minimum**: 80-100 words (if extremely clear)
- **Maximum**: 350 words (clients won't read walls of text on mobile)

Keep it scannable on mobile—short paragraphs, bullets, white space.

## Mobile Optimization

- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines max)
- Use bullets for readability
- Avoid long URLs (use portfolio link or case study reference)
- Test how proposal reads on phone screen width

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't copy-paste the same opening for multiple jobs
- ❌ Don't attach more than 2 samples
- ❌ Don't mention price/timeline until asked (unless job specifically asks)
- ❌ Don't use generic templates for EVERY proposal (customize opening at minimum)
- ❌ Don't lead with credentials ("I have 5-star reviews...") — lead with their problem
- ❌ Don't promise unlimited revisions without scope
- ❌ Don't ignore their specific tech stack or constraints

## Batch Customization Strategy

If bidding on 5 similar projects:
1. Write strong opening for first one (deep customization)
2. Copy bullets/proof/timeline for next 3 (these can be similar)
3. Always customize the opening 2-3 lines for each client

This takes 3 min per proposal instead of 30 min, while maintaining relevance.
